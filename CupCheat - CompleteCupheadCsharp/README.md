> ## Welcome here!

Thanks for reading this, here I will give you some tips:
- There are builded files, witch means you can just you can just run these with [.NET Framework 3.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net35-sp1-web-installer), don't need to build these.
I think you don't need to download .NET 3.5, because I think it's already on your Windows, but if it isn't, then download and install [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net35-sp1-web-installer).
- If you want to build it, please dont claim the rights or something, because it's mine. You can use it, but don't sell it or something.
- **For this app you need [Cuphead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead/)**
- For some reason the completed save isn't 200% complete, idk what is wrong it, but it doesn't mean anything. You still can play with it.
